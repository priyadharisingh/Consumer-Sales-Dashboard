# Consumer-Sales-Dashboard
The objective behind creating this sales dashboard for an ecommerce platform is to provide a deep insight into the key business metrics.

# Background:
With the increase in competition in ecommerce space, it is very important for every business to have their own dashboard which provides them with the live idea of how their business is performance. This could in turn help them make good business decisions, thus taking a lead by cutting the competition.
This company listed on the ecommerce platform was struggling with the sales metrics. Upon creating the dashboard and putting it to use it was found that the sales of the company is good in USA but due to less customer acquisition in Canada, the overall sales of the company shows downward trend. 
Further, diving into the product section we see that only 2 products namely phones and chairs derive the greatest number of sales in USA. Hence, we understand that there is greater need to advertise more products or run discounts for more customer acquisition.
Many more such insights were made that helped the stakeholders have an idea about the problems in their business and necessary measures were taken to fix them.

# Assumption:
•	The data does not contain manually created bias.
•	Live updates depend on syncing frequency (daily/hourly).

# Dashboard Design
1.	Sales Overview – total revenue, sales trend, top categories.
2.	Time Series Analysis – 
The profit with respect to the year, month, quarter & date. The graph gives us an idea that greater revenue & profit is generated towards the end of the year that is in the months of October, November & December. This chart is also affected by the Country & Year slicers on the top.

3.	Top Categories - 
Total Sales by sub category is affected by the slicer Top N slicer on the top right corner. The default in the slicer gives us the value for all the sub category, top 10 gives us the value for the top 10 sub category by the total sales & the same way top 5 & top 20 are provide the required bars in the chart.

# Analysis:
1.	Phones and chairs derive the greatest number of sales. This could be due to the fact that the products are consumed by both corporates and consumers.
2.	In the month of December most amount of sales is recorded. This could be due to increase in purchase by the people owing to Christmas and New Year.
3.	Least amount of sales is booked in the month of January, this is become people have bought all the required items in December itself. This is not a red flag for the company as they has also recorded large amount of sales in the previous month. This time should be utilized in restocking the inventory.
4.	The consumer segment is deriving most amount of sales. However, segments namely Corporate and Office Supplies are contributing 41% and 37% to the overall sales. We need more data to understand why this is happening.
5.	USA contributes to 90% of the sales made by the company and Canda accounts to only 10%, this could be because of two reasons:
•	It has only been two years since the company has opened stores in Canda.
•	More advertising is needed to acquire more number of Canadian customers. 
# Conclusion:
The dashboard is of utmost importance and can provide real time access to stakeholders about the operations of the company. It provides them with a better idea of the business metrics and help make informed decisions.
